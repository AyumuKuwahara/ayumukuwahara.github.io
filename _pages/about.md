Hi, I am Ayumu Kuwahara (桑原歩), a postdoc at Center for Star and Planet Formation, Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen.

I am interested in planet formation. How planets form?  Even simple questions like this still cannot be fully answered by modern planetary science. I struggle with this mystery using analytical formulae and numerical simulations, attempting to reproduce on a blackboard or a computer a phenomenon that may be occurring somewhere in the universe at a certain instant. It is a bit like creating another small universe in the palm of your hand. By engaging in this field and with science as my weapon of choice, I can enjoy confronting the magnificently endless universe.

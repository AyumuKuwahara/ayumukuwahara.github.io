**About me**
Hi, I am Ayumu Kuwahara, a postdoc at Center for Star and Planet Formation, GLOBE Institute, University of Copenhagen.
I am interested in theoretical aspect of planet formation. How did planets like the one we live on form?  Even simple questions like this still cannot be fully answered by modern planetary science. I struggle with this mystery using analytical formulae. I also apply an approach called numerical simulation and attempt to reproduce on a blackboard or a computer a phenomenon that may be occurring somewhere in the universe at a certain instant. It is a bit like creating another small universe in the palm of your hand. By engaging in this field and with science as my weapon of choice, I can enjoy confronting the magnificently endless universe.
 
Key words: Planet formation, Pebble accretion, Hydrodynamics in a Protoplanetary disk, etc.
